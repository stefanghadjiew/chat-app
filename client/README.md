The functionality is almost identical to my ToWatchApp but i really want to practice user auth and data connection on the backend(NodeJs+MongoDB) and data flow and state in react.The main difference is that im going all functional components and hooks this time.Also using Material UI.
So... the app has user authentication and authorization.I use 3 different documents stored in Mongo - user,messages and friends.I need to dive into WebSockets in order to proceed further.For now i removed the friend functionality(although the components and routes are still present).I have 2 user accounts (herokutest@gmail.com/herokutest herokutest@abv.bg/herokutest1) that have some messages between them.Check them out !
