First attempt of creating a chat application.It is work in progress,but the main goal is for me and couple of my friends to use it instead of Telegram :).The functionality
is almost identical to my ToWatchApp but i really want to practice user auth and data connection on the backend(NodeJs+MongoDB) and data flow and state in react.The main difference is that im going all functional components and hooks this time.Also using Material UI.
So... the app has user authentication and authorization.I use 3 different documents stored in Mongo - user,messages and friends.Functionally i still have to pass argument to  useEffect so that it updates when user adds a new friend and i would like to also create a new chat window for every friend when the user click on them.Currently working on that part
