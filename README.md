Simple chatt ap that me and my friends are going to use instead of Telegram :).The functionality
is almost identical to my ToWatchApp but i really want to practice user auth and data connection on the backend(NodeJs+MongoDB) and data flow and state in react.The main difference is that im going all functional components and hooks this time.Also using Material UI.
So... the app has user authentication and authorization(again via jsonwebtokens stored in localstore).I use 2 different dbs - one for user and one for messages.Each user can ofcourse create a message and delete only messages that he/she has created.
